# Whitegrove
An experimental semi-interactive roguelike built in Rust.

My other research roguelike, [Downdelving](https://github.com/ndouglas/downdelving/), is at this point somewhat traditional.  It was built following Bracket's [exceptional tutorial](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/).

_Whitegrove_ is quite different.  It's roguelike in some ways, but I'm not sure if it's really a game or not.  It may replace _Downdelving_, or it might sputter out and die in a matter of a few commits.

But here's the basic idea:

### Instead of controlling your `@` interactively...
You will program it using an embedded interpreter or other language.

### Instead of programming explicit artificial intelligence into mobs...
Mobs will utilize neural nets and evolve over generations, each generation being an encounter with the player, other mobs, and the simulated environment.

So IDK how well this will work in practice, but it might be kinda cool.  Let's find out.
